"""
Vivado TCL Session Manager - Maintains a persistent Vivado process using pexpect.

This module provides the core Vivado interaction layer for the MCP server.
It manages a persistent Vivado TCL session, avoiding the ~30 second startup
overhead that would occur if Vivado were launched for each command.

Architecture:
    The VivadoSession class spawns Vivado in TCL mode (-mode tcl) using pexpect.
    Commands are sent via sendline() and output is captured by waiting for the
    Vivado prompt (Vivado%). The session stays alive between commands, maintaining
    state (open projects, synthesized designs, etc.).

Key Design Decisions:
    1. Singleton Pattern: A global _session instance is used to ensure only one
       Vivado process runs at a time. Use get_session() to access it.

    2. Thread Safety: A threading lock protects command execution to prevent
       interleaved commands if multiple async tasks try to use Vivado.

    3. Prompt-Based Parsing: We wait for "Vivado%" prompt to know when a command
       completes. Output between command send and prompt is captured.

    4. Error Detection: Success/failure is determined by checking for error
       keywords in the output (ERROR:, invalid command, etc.).

    5. Statistics Tracking: Command count, timing, and error counts are tracked
       for debugging and performance analysis.

Usage:
    from vivado_session import get_session

    session = get_session()
    session.start()  # Launch Vivado

    result = session.run_tcl("open_project /path/to/project.xpr")
    if result.success:
        print(f"Project opened in {result.elapsed_ms}ms")

    session.stop()  # Clean shutdown

Dependencies:
    - pexpect: For spawning and interacting with Vivado process
    - Vivado: Must be installed and in PATH (or specify path explicitly)

# VIVADO SESSION CLASS

class VivadoSession:

    Manages a persistent Vivado TCL session using pexpect.

    Vivado is started once and kept running. Commands are sent and output
    is captured using pexpect's expect/sendline interface. This avoids the
    ~30 second startup time that would be incurred for each command.

    The session maintains state between commands, so you can open a project,
    run synthesis, and then query results - all using the same Vivado instance.

    Attributes:
        vivado_path: Path to the Vivado executable

        is_running: Whether Vivado is currently running
        current_project: Path to currently open project (if any)
        stats: Dictionary of session statistics

    Thread Safety:
        A lock (_lock) protects command execution. Multiple threads can
        safely call run_tcl(), though commands will be serialized.
